      I am a Registered Nurse working with patients in palliative care. 
      I am also a Reiki Master/Teacher and Therapeutic Touch Practitioner.
    </p>
    <p className="mainpage text">
    I always felt I was on a spiritual path.  I sought and achieved my Reiki mastery in 2014 with 
    Dean Noblett & Rebecca Couch from "Heartlight.ca".  They were and still are my guiding light through my 
    self-discovery. 
    </p>

    <p className="mainpage text">I volunteer at Margaret Bahen Hospice, and Doane House Hospice providing Reiki and Visualization sessions 
      to both patients and staff.       
    </p>

    <p className="mainpage text">I also do evening workshops at Doane House on an occasional basis, working with 
    the Bereavment Group, teaching relaxation and imagery techniques. 
    </p>


    <p className="mainpage text">
      I look forward to teaching and guiding you through your Reiki experience.
